# Final Fantasy IX Jump Rope Script for MacOS

This is a script for MacOS only.
For a Windows-based script, find the excellent script by Septmor here: https://github.com/septomor/FF9-Jump-Rope-Script
 
-------------------
 
### IMPORTANT
This was tested on a single computer with very specific internet speeds and latency.
More testers would be welcomed in order to prove the accuracy of this script and collaboration in order to tweak delay values
 
-------------------
 
### HOW TO USE
* Start your remote play
* Make sure Vivi is ready to start jumping with the `!` mark over his head
* Open `FF9-jump-rope-MacOS.scpt` on `Script Editor` app in your Mac
* Press the `play` button - If it fails, the `Script Editr` app can be really finicky to stop.

#### LATENCY
Latency is going to be the real deal breaker here. 
Even with this script it took me SEVERAL attempts to get it right (naturally failing at 1100+ jumps)
Make sure you have you latency reduced as much as possible.
 
A few hints to reduce latency:
- Avoid WiFi
- Connect your PS4 to your computer directly via ethernet
- Share your computer internet connection via ethernet to the PlayStation
- Close all your apps, background routines or absolutely anything else that can make your computer do work that is **not**
